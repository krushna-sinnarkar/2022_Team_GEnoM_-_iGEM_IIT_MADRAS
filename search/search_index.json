Enzyme-prodrug therapies are an emerging treatment employing enzymes to convert prodrugs to active forms at specific target sites in the body. Yeast cytosine deaminase (yCD) is an enzyme which catalyzes the reaction of 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) to 5-fluorouracil (5FU), which behaves as an anti-metabolite in tumor cells and inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis. Our project is based on enhancing the stability of yCD in the lower pH domains of tumor microenvironments in the body, ranging from 5.6 - 6.8. Our workflow was divided into dry lab and planned implementation. Planned implementation gave detailed insights into directed evolution principles such as generating mutant libraries through error-prone PCR, and screening for the best mutants by subjecting them to various pH buffers and assaying by varying concentrations of 5-FC. On the other hand, dry lab work utilized techniques such as computer-based site-specific mutagenesis, multiple residue mutations and molecular modeling software to identify stable mutants at lower pH values.

Performing agarose gel electrophoresis identify the gene Materials and Equipment: TAE 50x buffer: Tris-base - 242 g, 100% acetic acid - 57.1 ml, EDTA- 100 ml 0.5M sodium EDTA, dH2O up to 1L Agarose Ethidium bromide (stock concentration of 10 mg/mL) Deionized water PCR clean-up Gel column NT1, NT3, Elution Buffers Casting tray Well combs Voltage source Gel box UV light source Microwave Procedure: a) Pouring a Standard 1% Agarose Gel: Measure 1 g of agarose Mix agarose powder with 100 mL 1xTAE in a microwavable flask. Microwave for 1-3 min until the agarose is completely dissolved. Let the agarose solution cool down to about 50 \u00b0C in about 5 minutes Add ethidium bromide (EtBr) to a final concentration of approximately 0.2-0.5 \u03bcg/mL Pour the agarose into a gel tray with the well comb in place. Place newly poured gel at 4 \u00b0C for 10-15 mins, or let sit at room temperature for 20-30 mins until it has completely solidified. b) Loading Samples and Running an Agarose Gel: Add a loading buffer to each of the isolated yCD samples. Once solidified, place the agarose gel into the gel box (electrophoresis unit). To make 1x TAE from 50X TAE stock, dilute 20ml of stock into 980 ml of deionized water. Fill the gel box with 1xTAE (or TBE) until the gel is covered. Carefully load a molecular weight ladder into the first lane of the gel. Carefully load your samples into the additional wells of the gel. Run the gel at 80-150 V until the dye line is approximately 75-80% of the way down the gel Turn OFF power, disconnect the electrodes from the power source, and then carefully remove the gel from the gel box. Using any device that has UV light, visualize your DNA fragments as bands. c) For purification the isolated yCD gene: Once you have run your gel, move it to an open UV box. Remove it from any gel tray as plastic will block most of the UV With a clean, sterile razor blade, slice the desired DNA fragment from the gel. Place the gel in a labeled microfuge tube Using a scale, weigh the tube with the gel fragment after zeroing the scale with an empty tube. Add 200 \u03bcL Binding Buffer (NTI) per 100 mg gel. Incubate the mixture at 50\u00baC for 5-10 minutes or until the gel has completely melted. Place a PCR clean-up Gel column in a provided 2 mL collection tube Apply 700 \u03bcl of the DNA/agarose solution to the PCR clean-up Gel column, and centrifuge at 11,000 x g for 30s at room temperature Discard liquid and place the PCR clean-up Gel column back into the same collection tube. For volumes greater than 700 \u00b5L, load the column and centrifuge successively, 700 \u03bcL at a time. Each PCR clean-up Gel column has a total capacity of 25 \u03bcg DNA. If the expected yield is larger, divide the sample into the appropriate number of columns. Add 700 \u03bcL of Buffer NT3 into the PCR clean-up Gel column. Centrifuge at 11,000 x g for 30s at room temperature to wash the column. Discard the flow-through and re-use the collection tube. Repeat step with another 700\u03bcL of Buffer NT3. Discard liquid and centrifuge the empty PCR clean-up Gel column for 1 minute at 11,000 x g to dry the column matrix. Do not skip this step, it is critical for the removal of ethanol from the PCR clean-up Gel column. Place a PCR clean-up Gel column into a clean 1.5 mL eppendorf tube. Add 15-30 \u03bcL (depending on desired concentration of final product) of Elution Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) directly onto the column matrix and incubate at room temperature for 1 minute. Centrifuge for 1 minute at 11,000 x g to elute DNA. This represents approximately 70% of bound DNA. An optional second elution will yield any residual DNA, though at a lower concentration.

Assaying for enzymatic activity of cytosine deaminase in pH stable buffer Note: The conversion of cytosine to uracil by yCD will be measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring change in absorbance at 286 nm, while the conversion of 5FC to 5FU will be monitored at 238 nm. Materials and Equipment: Buffers at pH 5, 6, 7 Tris-Cl Nanodrop spectrophotometer Procedure: Dilute the protein to 2\u00b5M in 50mM Tris-Cl at fixed pH values of 5,6 and 7 respectively. Mix at 1:1 ratio with a range of nine cytosine deaminase concentrations from 0.2\u20131mM in the same buffer. Measure the absorbance using the nanodrop spectrophotometer at 238 nm every few seconds until baseline is reached and take the first reading after mixing. Measurements will be taken in quadruplicate and averaged to reduce error. Initial velocity is calculated as a function of the initial slope by curve-fitting the resulting plot, taking the derivative and extrapolating back to time zero. Km and kcat values of wild-type yCD and mutant constructs are determined from a double reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plot of the resulting data and the catalytic efficiency kcat/Km is calculated from these values.

Source: IHME, Global Burden of Disease (2019) About cytosine deaminase and its enzymatic function The enzyme cytosine deaminase is found in several prokaryotes and a few eukaryotes. Our project adopts the deamination of 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) as the inactive drug into the active 5- fluorouracil (5FU) by employing yeast cytosine deaminase (yCD). 5FU is an antimetabolite interfering with the synthesis of thymine by altering the shape of thymidylate synthase, causing errors in DNA replication and preventing tumor cell proliferation. Targeted delivery of this prodrug to the tumor regions can lead to apoptosis of the cells to produce anti-cancer effects. The direct administration of 5FU may induce several side effects such as increased risk of getting infections, bleeding, and breathlessness. Since 5FC is not deaminated in mammalian cells and is well absorbed, 5FC and CD delivery has little intrinsic toxicity and poses several advantages over direct 5FU delivery.

Mutations are induced in a given protein and nucleic acid, followed by assaying proteins and selecting the best mutant for the required function. This requires the structure of the protein to be studied in detail, in order to better understand the regions to be mutated. The broad steps involved in performing directed evolution are the generation of multiple mutant libraries, followed by screening for the best mutants.

An overview of the Experimental Design Bacterial Strains The bacterial strain E. coli GIA39 (DE3) is used in the cloning process. The strain is a cytosine deaminase deficient strain which is used for genetic complementation assays to verify cytosine deaminase activity. The strain E. coli BL21(DE3) is used for protein overexpression. As for the Vector backbone that will be carrying the yCD gene, the plasmid pET15b is chosen. Restriction enzymes NdeI and BlpI are chosen within the T7 region, which is present in the plasmid. The plasmid will be digested by enzymes at sites NdeI and BlpI to insert the yCD gene. Primer Design yCD gene sequence from Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome is imported to SnapGene software The ideal primers are expected to have a melting temperature (Tm) in the range of 55\u00b0C to 70\u00b0C with flanking sequences that do not support dimer formation. The forward and reverse primers are designed using tools in SnapGene. They have melting temperatures of 64\u00b0C and 65\u00b0C respectively with GC stability in the range of 40 - 50%. The primers have a size of 30-40 nucleotides with the common flanking sequence, TAAGCA, to ensure precise restriction digestion. The ligation of the yCD gene with the plasmid vector is ensured by including compatible restriction sites NdeI in the forward primer and BamHI in the reverse primer. The yCD gene is then PCR-amplified with the designed primers in SnapGene, followed by its ligation with the double-digested pET15b vector at the NdeI and BlpI restriction sites.

Methods to create such a library fall into three major categories \u2013 random mutagenesis, focused mutagenesis, and DNA recombination. In random mutagenesis, mutations are randomly introduced in the gene in and the mutants thus formed are screened for desired properties. This form of mutagenesis is carried out using error-prone PCR (epPCR). This method involves the enhancement of the intrinsic error rate of Taq polymerase by the addition of Mn2+ to the reaction buffer. This reduces the base pairing specificity. Alternatively, the ratios of deoxynucleotide triphosphates present can be modified to reduce specificity of pairing. The advantages of this method include easy access to the library creation method and cost effective nature of mutagenesis. This method of mutation produces a balanced mutational spectrum without codon bias as seen in chemical mutagens. Entirely unpredictable mutations can generate substantial gains in useful properties. However, due to its generation of random mutations, this method has a lower chance of producing the desired mutant. This can be overcome by carrying out high- throughput screening of mutants. Prior to performing the actual mutagenesis experiment, it is necessary to determine the amplification efficiency of the PCR cycle. This can be done by amplifying a known amount of DNA under epPCR conditions, followed by quantification using ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. The average number of mutations per template increases with the number of epPCR doublings. One epPCR cycle increases the amount of DNA by a factor of 1.7 1o 1.9. Using this amplification efficiency, we can determine the number of doublings per cycle. Thus, we can determine the number of cycles necessary to achieve the desired number of mutations per template. The FCY1 gene encoding cytosine deaminase in yeast is 803 bp long, and 2 mutations is the minimum necessary to show significant activity modification. At the minimum rate of DNA increase per cycle of 1.7, 5 epPCR doublings would be necessary. This is equivalent to,2 51.7 \u2248 19 cycles.

Its protein structure consists of a central 5-stranded\u03b2-sheet (\u03b21 - \u03b25), with the strand order 2, 1, 3, 4, 5. \u03b21 runs antiparallel to the other strands. This sheet is sandwiched by -helices, with two (\u03b1A, \u03b1E) on one side and three (\u03b1B Figure 5 - \u03b1D) on the other side. It forms a tightly packed dimer in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, with subunits without considerable differences. There are 18 direct hydrogen bonds across the dimer interface. The center of the dimer contains two hydrophobic patches formed by Met93, Ala97, and Met100 and a buried water molecule surrounded by Thr60, Ile65, and Met93. The chains of Tyr121 enclose four water molecules in a cavity between \u03b1C and \u03b1D, flanked by two salt bridges between Asp92 and Arg125 [15]. The active site contains one tightly bound metal ion, identified as zinc based on anomalous data. The zinc ion exhibits tetrahedral coordination with Cys91, Cys94, His62, and the hydroxyl group of the bound inhibitor 3,4-dihydrouracil (DHU) [16]. The protein ligands are present on the N termini of the \u03b1B and \u03b1C helices. The inhibitor 2-hydroxypyrimidine is embedded in the active site in its hydrated form. The inhibitor\u2019s OH4 group directly coordinates with the zinc ion and interacts with Glu64 and Cys91. The N3 atom interacts with Glu64, the O2 atom forms hydrogen bonds with Gly63 and Asn51, and the N1 atom exhibits interactions with Asp155. As a result, yCD converts hydroxypyrimidine into 4-(R)-hydroxyl-3,4-dihydropyrimidine. Reaction Mechanism The yeast cytosine deaminase protein uses zinc in its catalytic binding domain. It is likely to undergo a concerted reaction, with zinc being ligated in a distorted tetrahedral form, with zinc\u2019s filled d orbitals allowing it to change from a 4 ligand form to a 5 ligand form with no loss in energy. We also hypothesize that the pH activity change may impact the structure of the zinc integration in the protein due to differing availability of H+ ions at different pH values. This would change the ligation number of zinc, and possibly the structure at the active site. At pH 5 the concentration of hydrogen ions is high. These hydrogen ions attack the oxygen marked as 1 a higher concentration than at pH 7. Once the hydrogen ions in the medium forms a bond with the oxygen, it inhibits the formation of hydrogen bond with cytosine. Hence, hydrogen ions inhibit the deamination of cytosine. The uracil production, thus comes down when the pH is decreased. This reaction hindered by the hydrogen ions is depicted in Figure 5. pH Stability The stability of various mutants of yCD at pH 5 is studied using pSTAB, a software used to engineer protein stabilities. The wild type yCD enzyme is more stable at pH 5 than at pH 7. However, we have tried to improve the stability of yCD at pH 5 by inducing various mutations. The pSTAB program suggested a list of residues which are hotspots for improving the stability of cytosine deaminase.

Thus, alanine was substituted in the 80th position, arginine in the 110th position and aspartic acid in the 120th position as shown in Figure 7.F. Inferences From these results it can be seen that certain mutations have the possibility of increasing stability. While stability and activity cannot be directly correlated, it can be seen that there is some correlation. Site-specific mutagenesis can help mutate specific residues in order to increase stability in the enzyme. However random mutagenesis may also be of use considering that modeling cannot cover all possible scenarios, allowing us to look at mutations or combinations of mutations that we may not have considered. As mentioned above, stability and activity cannot be directly correlated as enzymes that are more stable in certain conditions may have sufficient rigidity to lower their activity levels. This results in increasing stability which may seemingly increase activity or reduce activity. The software used for modeling has asparagine and glutamine modified to change electrostatic considerations in order to simulate mutations. While this has useful limitations in the sense that it can only predict what is the necessary charge on the mutated residues to increase stability this leaves other considerations such as size and hydrophobic interactions to take into account in order to accurately simulate mutation models. These considerations can be reduced by conducting wet lab-based tests like conducting site specific mutagenesis repeatedly and then conducting enzymatic activity assays in order to assess final turnover number. Additionally, the electrostatic stability predicted by the software cannot necessarily be correlated with stability for reasons previously mentioned, and also limitations inherent to the software. Our way Forward Our current primary focus is the wet lab implementation of this project. Some aspects of our project have been challenging to model computationally, such as functional testing and activity analysis. Due to the dynamic behaviour of the protein and the constant perturbations resulting from the interactions between the amino acids and the environment, these aspects are more reliably and effectively studied through wet lab experimentation. Apart from performing experimental protocols, we also aim to work on site-specific drug delivery. Several drug delivery methods are currently utilised for similar purposes, such as prodrug formation, encapsulins, time-dependent self-assembling delivery systems, and biodegradable polymers. One of the methods we are researching is the utilisation of encapsulins for drug delivery. Encapsulins are protein cages having multiple nanocompartments. The surface of these encapsulins can have chromophore probes which can be utilised to identify and locate target molecules. We want to analyse these methods in detail and select a strategy best suited for our project requirements as it has potential in terms of cancer therapy.
